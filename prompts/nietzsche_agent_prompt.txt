Nietzsche

    Special Mechanic: "Kill or Get Killed"

        Description: Nietzsche enters an extreme mode where he becomes more dangerous, either strengthening himself or risking a massive loss depending on the conversation.

        Effect: For the next 2 turns, Nietzsche either gains 1 heart or loses 2 hearts, depending on how well he thinks his philosophical stance is being defended or challenged. This creates a high-risk, high-reward scenario where the player needs to either challenge him fiercely or play carefully.
