        Special Mechanic: "Life Steal"

    Description: The Cynic feeds off the playerâ€™s despair. If he wins two bouts in a row, he starts stealing life from the player.

    Effect: After winning two consecutive argument bouts, the Cynic can drain 1 heart from the player, healing himself for the same amount. This creates a feedback loop where the player must break the cycle of losing to avoid the Cynic healing and becoming even more difficult to defeat.
