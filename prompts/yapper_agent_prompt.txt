Yapper

    Special Mechanic: "Interrupting Babble"

        Description: The Yapper’s incessant talking disrupts the player’s focus, preventing them from taking action for a short duration.

        Effect: Every time the player tries to make a move (whether it’s a response, roll, or action), the Yapper’s constant chatter forces a delay (e.g., 2-3 seconds), mimicking the experience of being interrupted constantly. The player has to wait through a quick burst of irrelevant dialogue before they can proceed.
